# hobbyOS  
The operating system of my dreams. And it becomes better for everyone, every day.

## To Do
- [X] Create bootsector.
- [ ] Write kernel in C.
- [ ] Link files using Linker script (LD).
- [ ] Use nasm for assembly code.
- [ ] Use gcc for C code.
- [ ] After coding kernel completely, work on Graphical User Interface.

## Ideas
- Privacy and Security comes from Linux. (free & open-source)
- Smoothness and Animations comes from Mac.
- User-Friendly UI that combines Mac and Windows features.
- ARM64 CPU for long-lasting battery and good performance.
